1,Towards a global One Health index: a potential assessment tool for One Health performance,"Zhang, Xiao Xi",10.1186/s40249-022-00979-9,Dec-22,"Global one health Index (GOHI)   external drivers index (EDI), intrinsic drivers index (IDI, core drivers index (CDI), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Processing (FAHP)","The global community has increasingly embraced the idea of One Health recognizing its value in comprehending the connections, between animal and environmental well being. Nevertheless the limited availability of evidence has impeded the application and integration of this approach into policymaking. This study seeks to tackle this challenge by suggesting the creation of an assessment tool that can evaluate the performance of One Health. Such a tool would aid in measuring the impact and effectiveness of this approach while pinpointing areas where capacity development is urgently needed.","We will outline a five step approach to develop a One Health index (GOHI). These steps involve formulating the framework, selecting indicators building a database determining weights and calculating scores. Our proposed framework, for resembles the structure of cells. Consists of three main components; the external drivers index (EDI) intrinsic drivers index (IDI) and core drivers index (CDI). To establish the indicator scheme for GOHI we engaged in rounds of panel discussions, with our advisory committee. We then employed an hierarchy process to assign weights to each indicator.",,"The GOHIs weighted indicator system consists of three primary indicators, thirteen secondary indicators and fifty seven tertiary indicators. After analyzing data from, over 200 countries/territories we observed that the overall GOHI scores are far from ideal (reaching a score of 65.0 out of 100). Additionally there were variations among countries/territories (ranging from 31.8 to 65.0). These findings align with the results obtained through a literature review indicating that using GOHI as an assessment tool, for One Health performance is potentially feasible.","GOHI if subjected to validation would be considered as the assessment tool that creates a comprehensive framework, for understanding One Health from a holistic standpoint. The future utilization of GOHI could contribute to fostering a shared comprehension of the One Health approach and serve as a point of reference for implementing strategies to enhance capacity building in the field. To ensure its relevance, in situations GOHI will be regularly updated with revised protocols and databases to address any existing limitations and incorporate new insights.","GOHI is a very good measure and indeed very capable, constructed by using FAHP via the indicator scorings through experts from different forte.  The demographical majority of experts from China raises some bias. Also, for using the common indicators framework many sensitive indicators have been dropped to entertain the inclusion of the majority of nations (due to absence of data) which is a limitation."
2,Toward One Health: a spatial indicator system to model the facilitation of the spread of zoonotic diseases,"Jato-Espino,Daniel",10.3389/fpubh.2023.1215574,29-06-2023,Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA )             Technique for order of priority by similarity to solution (TOPSIS)          GIS (Geographic Information System)                                        MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making)    GDP (Gross Domestic Product),"The repeated occurrence of infections that can be transmitted between humans and animals highlights the role of animal and environmental health, in disease prevention and control. This has given rise to the concept of ""One Health,"" which recognizes the interconnectedness of animal health within their ecosystems. The objective of this study is to develop a model that can indicate how zoonotic diseases spread. To begin we conducted a review of literature following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The selected indicators focused on both animal health aspects. We examined factors such as demographics, socio economic conditions, interactions between animals and humans as water bodies, ambient air quality and climate related environmental conditions. These indicators were analyzed using values obtained from existing literature or calculated through distance analysis tasks and other methods. Finally we utilized criteria decision making techniques like Entropy and technique for order of priority by similarity to solution (TOPSIS) to combine these indicators into a comprehensive metric, for evaluating the spread of zoonotic diseases.","The objective of this study is to develop a model that can indicate how zoonotic diseases spread.

The proposed indicator system can therefore be used as a starting point for planning strategies that are in line with One Health principles. Depending on the results obtained, such strategies may focus on preserving natural landscape features to reduce habitat loss, preserve land and water resources and reduce extreme atmospheric conditions.",,"This study examined the indicator system in the 33 Counties of the Community as shown in Figure 2. Valencian Community, located in the part of Spain has a Mediterranean climate characterized by dryness and semi-dryness. Regions, with Mediterranean ecosystems often face degradation caused by factors like wildfires, droughts, erosion, tourism, urbanization, and deforestation. Furthermore, climate change has an impact on rainfall patterns potentially leading to desertification in drought areas. The region's social dynamics are influenced by the service sector (employing over 65% of the workforce) and tourism activities (contributing than 12% to employment and 15%, to GDP).         A tourism model has been constructed by the Valencian Community   focused upon second homes connected to construction consequences being serious environmental impacts, high space needs, and an 
unsustainable approach.
Due to lax political guidelines 
and favorable economic incentives, all these activities have skyrocketed leading to land degradation. Thus, insufficient budgetary resources tend to challenge meeting the goal of recovering 15% of degraded 
ecosystems. Different studies point towards the reforestation projects by the Valencian community which have a
limited effect on biodiversity, while neglecting medium and long-termeconomic restoration project"," In this study the development, application, and validation of a system that measures the vulnerability of areas to the spread of diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans has been done in this study. This system indirectly assesses the contributions made to One Health focusing specifically on the Valencian Communities, in Spain. The methodology involved conducting a review of existing literature combining GIS (Geographic Information System) with MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) and performing tests. The literature review identified 22 indicators that're relevant to understanding human animal interactions, including factors such as population density and land use patterns. By analyzing these indicators using GIS and MCDM techniques we were able to create a measure of susceptibility to diseases. Our findings emphasize the significance of controlling sprawl as a means to mitigate encroachment, on habitats.The impact of urbanization was evident when analyzing the county level data. It was discovered that the county closest, to the capital and city in the area had the highest susceptibility to zoonotic diseases. Additionally there was a correlation between the results of an indicator system and artificial general interest (""GI""). Conversely there was an inverse relationship between semi GI highlighting the significance of these areas, for preserving habitats and biodiversity which aligns with One Health principles. The validity of these findings was further confirmed by records from 2021.","This study is based on the Valencian community to observe the animal, health, and environment collaborative model to indicate how zoonotic diseases spread. This study has brought out very promising positive correlations being affirmed by the previous year's data and thus has provided the community with the exact status and prevention measures they can take to decrease the spread.Thus,this can be a tool to implement the principles of one health approach when designing strategies for improved public space planning."
3,One Health Surveillance: A Matrix to Evaluate Multisectoral Collaboration,Marion Bordier,10.3389/fvets.2019.00109,24-04-2019,"Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH) framework, One Health Assessment for Planning & Performance (OH-APP
tool), Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)","The international community along, with organizations actively supports the implementation of One Health surveillance systems that focus on monitoring health risks for humans, animals and the environment. In our perspective a key aspect of a health surveillance system is the collaboration between institutions and sectors to plan, coordinate and carry out the surveillance process. However the models and methods used for this effort vary depending on the purpose and context of the surveillance. ","The objective of our study is to create a matrix that evaluates the quality and effectiveness of sectoral collaboration by analyzing its organizational structure, implementation strategies and functionalities. To achieve this goal we compiled a list of assessment attributes based on factors like characteristics and existing criteria used for evaluating health surveillance systems or One Health initiatives. These attributes went through two rounds of refinement which included 23 attributes, 9 attributes, as well, as 3 organizational indexes that measure overall collaboration within an organization. After completing the task we proceeded to narrow down 75 criteria to evaluate and measure the satisfaction of attributes and indices. We used a scoring system with four levels to assign scores to these criteria. The visual representations provided an overview of the evaluation results, for both attributes and indices. This evaluation matrix is groundbreaking as it enables us to conduct an analysis of collaboration within a surveillance system involving stakeholders. It serves as a milestone towards creating a tool, for assessing collaboration. This tool will be extremely useful in determining the strengths and limitations of collaboration occurring within a multi-layered surveillance system after subjecting it to different context and application.",OASIS                                                                                                            ,"Based on the analysis of three information sources, a list of 38 attributes relevant to the evaluation of collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system was identified. These attributes were categorized into five groups: governance (9), operation (8), effectiveness (10), function (7), and value (4).

84 experts participated in the expert-opinion elicitation process, with 39 respondents fully completing the questionnaire. Most respondents were epidemiologists (74%) and veterinarians (72%). All proposed attributes were considered relevant by 67% of respondents, with 43% stating that no attributes were missing.

Major amendments were made to the initial list of attributes based on expert inputs. Some attributes were renamed, split, discarded, or added to better evaluate collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system.

The final list of attributes included 23 organizational attributes (13 for governance and 10 for operation) and 9 functional attributes.

Three indexes were defined to support the macro-evaluation of collaboration: operation index, support index, and management index.","The development of this evaluation matrix represents a significant advancement in the assessment of collaboration within multisectoral surveillance systems. As the importance of collaboration across sectors and disciplines continues to grow for more efficient surveillance systems, there is a pressing need for tools to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of this collaboration in relation to specific objectives and contexts.

This matrix offers a comprehensive approach to collaboration evaluation, addressing various dimensions:

Microlevel assessment of collaboration's organization based on specific attributes.
Macrolevel evaluation using indexes that encompass a wide array of contributing elements.
Examination of core collaborative functions through dedicated attributes.
The validation of these evaluation attributes by experts in the One Health surveillance field highlights their potential applicability beyond multisectoral surveillance systems. These attributes can also serve to evaluate collaboration in other surveillance contexts and, with necessary adaptations, in diverse multi-stakeholder systems.

To finalize this tool, it will undergo field-testing and the development of a standardized framework for its application. Once these steps are completed, the matrix will enable the evaluation of collaboration's capacity to achieve its objectives within a multisectoral setting, identifying strengths and weaknesses in organization, implementation, and functionality. The results can then inform recommendations for enhancing collaboration quality and appropriateness.","The evaluation matrix and criteria have been developed to assess collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system. The process involved input from experts and resulted in a refined list of attributes and evaluation criteria. These tools can help evaluate the effectiveness and quality of collaboration in such systems, enabling organizations to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements where necessary.  The development of these tools represents an important step toward enhancing multisectoral surveillance efforts and improving the overall performance of surveillance systems in various sectors, including veterinary science and public health.

4,"Outcomes From Using Mortality, Antimicrobial Consumption, and Vaccine Use Data for Monitoring Endemic Diseases in Danish Swine Herds","Lopes Antunes, Ana Carolina",10.3389/fvets.2019.00041,22-02-2019,"Central Husbandry Register (CHR), Swine Movement Database (SMD), Animal Daily Doses (ADD),    Specific Pathogen Free (SPF),   Weighted Percentage of Alarms (WPA),  Weighted Percentage of False Alarms (WPFA), Animal Daily Doses (ADD)","The aim of the study was to assess how different data sources are used in Denmark to monitor diseases. The research included 45 farms and 81 joint operation units (where multiple farms are considered as one unit, with movement of swine and personnel between them and having the same disease status) from January 2014 to September 2017. In total there were 95 farms that tested negative for three diseases (Purs, Enzootic Pneumonia and Porcine Pleuropneumonia) based on serology. The analysis was carried out separately for age groups such, as weaners (30 kg) sows and ﬂishers herds within each category.In a nutshell 30% of the herds showed signs of concern, up to three months before their disease situation changed based on mortality data. Additionally once respiratory disease data was taken into account all herds raised alarms within one month regarding use. The impactful disease observed at the herd level was Porcine Pleuropneumonia (PPE). Alarms across all three data streams coincided with the month when herds transitioned from PPE to PPE and, in the months. Notably a majority of alarms related to vaccine usage were registered within one month.","Mortality Data: Swine mortality data in Denmark were obtained from the Central Husbandry Register (CHR) and the Swine Movement Database (SMD). The CHR contains farm demographics and swine numbers, while the SMD records swine movements, including dead animals transported to rendering plants. Monthly mortality rates were calculated based on the number of dead animals in a herd divided by the number of animals recorded in the CHR for that herd.

VetStat Data: Records of antimicrobial and vaccine purchases made by Red-SPF farms between December 2013 and September 2017 were analyzed. Antimicrobial use was measured in Animal Daily Doses (ADD) per kilogram of animal weight. Monthly antimicrobial consumption and vaccine usage per pig-day were calculated for different age groups.

Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) System Data: Changes in SPF health status for farms in Denmark were monitored using letters sent to farmers when their SPF status changed. Diagnostic test results, changes due to positive test results or purchases from positive farms, and quarterly reports of healthy farms were used to identify disease status changes.

Weighted Percentage of Alarms (WPA): Shewhart control charts were used to monitor changes in data streams (mortality, antimicrobial usage, and vaccine use) for herds. Thresholds based on standard deviations were defined. The WPA was calculated as the percentage of herds with alarms exceeding the thresholds for a given month.

Weighted Percentage of False Alarms (WPFA): False alarm rates generated by Shewhart control charts were calculated using mortality, antimicrobial consumption, and vaccine data from healthy Red-SPF farms. The WPFA represented the percentage of herds with no alarms (false alarms) for a given month.

This methodology enabled the monitoring of disease status changes, antimicrobial usage, and vaccine usage in swine herds in Denmark over a specific period, with a focus on detecting alarms and false alarms using control charts and threshold-based analysis.",,"The study analyzed a total of 53 letters sent to individual operation unit farms and 40 letters sent to farms within joint operation units. The analysis covered the period from January 2014 to September 2017 and focused on changes in disease status among Red-SPF farms and herds.

Key findings from the study include:

1. The number of Red-SPF farms that became positive for Enzootic pneumonia was higher for both individual and joint operation units compared to herds that became positive for PRRS and porcine pleuropneumonia during the study period.

2. Monitoring the total antimicrobial consumption did not raise alarms for herds in either type of operation unit.

3. Alarms based on vaccine use generally occurred in the same month (i.e., month 0) as changes in disease status for both individual and joint operation units.

4. For individual operation units, alarms based on mortality increased for sow herds up to 2 months prior to their disease status becoming PRRS-positive. An increase in alarms based on antimicrobial use for respiratory diseases was seen 1 month prior to becoming PRRS-positive.

5. For enzootic pneumonia, increases in alarms based on mortality and antimicrobial use for respiratory diseases in weaner, sow, and finisher herds were found up to 4 months prior to disease status change.

6. For joint operation units, alarms based on mortality and antimicrobial consumption for respiratory diseases were found 3 months prior in herds that became PRRS-positive.

7. The highest weighted percentage of alarms (WPA) based on different data streams and thresholds varied for different diseases and data types, occurring before, during, or after disease status changes.

8. A total of 95 healthy Red-SPF farms were included in the study, and data on mortality, antimicrobial consumption, and vaccine usage were collected for different age groups within these farms.

9. Most herds showed WPFA>0 based on mortality and antimicrobial consumption data for respiratory diseases, except for consumption data in finishers.

10. There were limited records of vaccine usage for PRRS, enzootic pneumonia, and porcine pleuropneumonia, with only one finisher herd having records of vaccine usage for porcine pleuropneumonia.

These findings provide insights into the monitoring of disease status and related parameters in Red-SPF farms and herds within individual and joint operation units during the study period.","The study found that monitoring changes in mortality rates and the use of antibiotics for respiratory diseases in herds revealed early signs (alarms) of disease outbreaks before they were officially confirmed by diagnostic tests. These findings suggest that these data streams could be valuable tools for monitoring diseases and could contribute to the development of effective monitoring and surveillance strategies at a national level, which would be beneficial for the Danish government.","This study explored the use of different data sources in Denmark to monitor swine diseases.

The findings suggest that monitoring these data streams can provide early indications (alarms) of disease outbreaks before they are officially confirmed. This information could be valuable for disease monitoring and surveillance strategies at the national level, particularly for the Danish government."
5,"One Health Index (OHI) applied to Curitiba, the ninth-largest metropolitan area of Brazil, with concomitant assessment of animal, environmental, and human health indicators","De Moura, Raphael Rolim",10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100373,Jun-22,"principal component analysis (PCA), social vulnerability index (SVI), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA),  One Health Index (OHI)","One Health has been described as an all-encompassing strategy for promoting the health of people, animals, and the environment, but it has been unable to produce a precise index for evaluating individual cities, states, or nations. In light of this, the current study sought to determine the One Health Index (OHI) in 29 cities within the Curitiba metropolitan region, which is Brazil's ninth largest. The city's environment secretary provided the health indicators for both animals and the environment. The overall human health measure was the social vulnerability index (SVI). The parameters for the indicators were set up using binary logic. In relation to city population, per capita income, and distance from the capital Curitiba, principal component analysis (PCA) was used. Using the three first coefficients of the principal components generated from the Principal Component Analysis Plot (PCA), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to examine a pairwise comparison between the scenario ranges. A p value below 0.05 was regarded as significant. Overall, a lower OHI was seen in low-income cities compared to higher-income cities, and a greater OHI was linked to a higher city population, income, and proximity to the capital. In summary, the OHI presented here is a comprehensive picture of a city's overall health. Additionally, when calculating sustainability indices using OHI, animal issues should be viewed as a component of local to global sustainability.","Study Area
Our study took place in the Curitiba metropolitan area, located at 25°25'47"" S, 49°16'19"" W, which is the ninth most populous region in Brazil with an estimated population of 3,693,817 and a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.783. This area encompasses 29 cities (Fig. 1).

Data Collection
We collected animal health indicators from the city's environmental department, covering aspects such as animal protection, hoarding behavior, microchip usage, neutering programs, responsible ownership initiatives, and animal cruelty. Environmental health indicators, including waste management plans, recycling, object hoarding behavior, and ecological biodiversity, were obtained directly from city authorities. Human health was represented by the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which combines 16 social indicators across three domains (Urban Infrastructure, Human Capital, and Income and Work). Additional human and animal indicators are detailed in Supplementary Material 1, 2, and 3.

Statistical Analysis

Data Analyses
We converted indicators into binary logic, where ""yes"" responses equaled one, and ""no"" responses equaled zero. The ""Animal Health"" variable summed nine animal health indicators, while ""Environmental Health"" was double the sum of four environmental indicators. For ""Human Health,"" we adjusted the SVI using the formula:
HH = A × 10
Here, HH represents the municipality's Human Health score, A is the lowest SVI value among municipalities, and x is the municipality's SVI value.

We categorized municipalities based on population, per capita income, and distance from the capital (Supplementary Table 5). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed using the three health variables for each municipality. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted using the first three coefficients of the principal components obtained from PCA, along with pairwise comparisons between scenario ranges. Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment.

** Ethics Statement**
This study received approval from the Ethics Research Committee of Health Sciences at the Universidade Federal do Paraná (protocol number 1,105,785/15) and the Coordination of the State Secretary of Curitiba Metropolitan Area.",PCA                                                                                                     PERMANOVA,"We collected and presented data (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, and 8). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used with city population, per capita income, and distance from the state capital as major factors (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Overall, higher One Health Index (OHI) scores were associated with larger city populations, higher incomes, and closer proximity to the capital, as indicated by PCA analysis and PERMANOVA (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, and 8).

Spatial analysis on PCA axes x and y provided an overview of the 29 cities and variables, while PERMANOVA confirmed statistical significance (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Cities to the right and near axis x (e.g., Piraquara, Curitiba, and São José dos Pinhais) had higher OHI scores compared to cities on the left (e.g., Tunas do Paraná and Adrianópolis) with lower OHI, potentially influenced by human, environmental, and animal health indexes.

Cities with larger populations (over 50,000 inhabitants) exhibited higher human (average 7.54, SD 1.07), environmental (average 6.89, SD 1.05), and animal (average 7.22, SD 1.71) health scores than smaller population municipalities (below 10,000 inhabitants) with lower human (average 6.29, SD 1.58), environmental (average 3.6, SD 1.67), and animal (average 1.00, SD 0.7) health scores.

Municipalities closer to the state capital (0–25 km) scored higher in human (average 7.83, SD 0.99), environmental (average 7.25, SD 1.04), and animal (average 7.63, SD 1.51) health indexes compared to more distant ones (over 76 km) with lower human (average 6.96, SD 2.02), environmental (average 4.86, SD 2.27), and animal (average 1.29, SD 0.95) health scores.

Similarly, municipalities with higher income per capita (over R$700) had higher human (average 8.51, SD 0.82), environmental (average 6.57, SD 1.51), and animal (average 4.86, SD 3.76) health scores than those with lower income per capita (0-R$500), which scored lower in human (average 6.04, SD 1.00), environmental (average 4.86, SD 2.27), and animal (average 2.00, SD 1.53) health indexes.

Significant differences were observed in municipalities with higher population (PERMANOVA; F = 16.44; p = 0.012), closer proximity to the state capital Curitiba (PERMANOVA; F = 10.01; p = 0.010), and higher income per capita (PERMANOVA; F = 7.26; p = 0.04) when compared to municipalities with lower population, greater distance from the capital, and lower income per capita, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 3).","Finally despite the limitations imposed on animal and environmental rights it is suggested that the proposed OHI (Overall Health Indicator) may provide an representation of a citys overall health compared to other health indicators. It is essential to include animal welfare concerns, in the definition of sustainability and OHI should play a role in calculating sustainability indices. In contrast cities with incomes often lack a view of overall health when compared to those utilizing OHI. To summarize the presented OHI offers a perspective on a citys well being. Furthermore when assessing sustainability indices using OHI it is crucial to consider animal welfare as a component from local, to sustainable development.","The uniqueness of our study is simultaneously assessing human, animal, and environmental health indicators to create an integrated One Health Index (OHI). We used this index to generate spatial maps, associating it with factors like distance from the state capital, population, and income.

We mention other recent studies that explored multisectoral collaborations in One Health but primarily relied on questionnaires rather than actual assessments of health indexes. In contrast, our approach offers a practical and comprehensive measurement of One Health, allowing for comparisons across municipalities, states, and countries.

The OHI reveals significant differences among municipalities based on population, income, and distance from the state capital. For example, less populated and lower-income municipalities tend to have lower OHI scores. Additionally, cities closer to the state capital generally exhibit better One Health outcomes.

Despite some limitations, such as missing data on green coverage and the absence of companion animals in animal census data, our OHI proves to be a sensitive and specific indicator, rooted in the reality of the communities it represents.

We briefly discuss zoonotic diseases, emphasizing that their impact was relatively low in the study area. We acknowledge the need for further investigation into the relationship between natural areas and vector-borne disease occurrence.

Finally, we touch on the concept of sustainability and how it usually overlooks animals in its formula. While some environmental indicators indirectly relate to animal health, our OHI explicitly integrates animal health into the overall assessment, providing a more comprehensive view of health and sustainability."
6,Towards One Health disease surveillance: The Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance approach," Karimuribo, Esron D.",10.4102/ojvr.v79i2.454,26-06-2012,"Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS), One Health (OH), National Centre for Infectious Disease

Surveillance and Response (IDSR),  National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), 
Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), Joint Technical Committee (JTC),  Community-based Active Surveillance (CAS) ,  District-based Passive Surveillance (DPS)","In Africa, where infectious diseases pose a significant threat and resources are limited, the need for effective disease surveillance and control is paramount. Given that many human infectious diseases originate from animals, adopting a One Health (OH) approach is crucial, requiring collaboration across sectors. This study conducted a baseline assessment of existing human and animal health surveillance systems and developed a strategy for OH surveillance. The strategy incorporates participatory epidemiology and the use of mobile technology, such as next-generation Android phones running the EpiCollect app. This innovative approach aims to enhance disease alerting and surveillance in remote areas, with a focus on three specific ecosystems. The integration of participatory epidemiology and technology holds promise for significantly improving OH disease surveillance in southern Africa."," This study defines One Health (OH) surveillance as collaborative efforts between the human and animal health sectors to systematically collect and analyze disease event data, with timely dissemination of results for disease prevention and control.

Study Design: This research consisted of two phases. Phase 1 involved a baseline survey to evaluate the performance of current disease surveillance systems in both animal and human health sectors. Lessons learned from this phase informed the design of the OH surveillance system. Phase 2 focused on creating an OH surveillance system suitable for southern Africa.

Baseline Study on Surveillance Systems Assessment: A rapid situation analysis was conducted in May 2010 to understand the structure and requirements of surveillance systems in Tanzania. Field visits to health facilities in Ngorongoro district in November 2010 involved structured interviews with personnel responsible for disease event detection and reporting. Data were collected from 14 wards and 13 health facilities, covering approximately 62% of facilities in Ngorongoro. Disease surveillance reports submitted from 2005 to 2010 were also analyzed. The assessment evaluated the completeness and accuracy of surveillance reports over a five-year period.

Design of Southern African OH Surveillance Strategy: A participatory approach was used to select study sites and surveillance methods during an inception workshop in January 2010. The workshop recommended initiating pilot OH surveillance in the Ngorongoro ecosystem, with plans to expand to the Kagera River basin and Zambezi River basin. Collaborative efforts involved SACIDS, NatCIDS, government ministries, and academic institutions, with support from UK collaborators. Recommendations from the UK Foresight report on infectious diseases were also considered.

**Study Sites:** Three study sites were chosen: Ngorongoro, representing an area with extensive human-wildlife-domestic animal interactions; Kagera River basin, a cross-border ecosystem in eastern Africa; and Zambezi River basin, a large basin in southern Africa with international borders.

**Data Analysis:** Data collected during the baseline study were summarized, and descriptive statistics were computed where applicable. Trends by ward and health facility were presented graphically. Health facility names were coded to ensure blind reporting, aligning with ethical clearance conditions.",,"**Baseline Study on Surveillance System in Tanzania:**

- The surveillance structure for disease reporting in both animal and human health sectors in Tanzania was found to be similar. Disease event detection begins in communities, with community-based reporters identifying sick individuals. Official cadres, such as Livestock Field Officers (LFOs) in animal health and health facility in-charges or Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) focal persons in human health, prepare and submit disease surveillance reports.

- Disease surveillance and response coordination is at the district level, with District Veterinary Officers (DVO) and District Medical Officers (DMO) responsible for transmitting reports to higher authorities. These reports may go through intermediate levels (zonal VICs and RMO) or directly to the central level in the respective ministries.

- The animal health sector requires monthly disease reports, with immediate reporting for notifiable diseases. In contrast, the IDSR system in the human health sector mandates weekly and monthly reporting for different categories of diseases.

- The performance of disease surveillance systems was assessed. While both sectors had their challenges, human health facilities generally exhibited better reporting than animal health. Some wards and facilities consistently submitted reports more regularly than others.

**One Health Surveillance Strategy in Southern Africa:**

- The One Health (OH) surveillance strategy for southern Africa was developed through a participatory and consultative process, involving key stakeholders and experts. This strategy consists of two complementary systems: Community-based Active Surveillance (CAS) and District-based Passive Surveillance (DPS).

- CAS is designed to actively capture disease events in animal and human populations using simple case definitions. It employs community-based health reporters who actively screen for disease events and use Android mobile phones with the Epicollect data capture application for near-real-time data transmission.

- DPS utilizes existing surveillance strategies in both animal and human health sectors, enhancing performance through mobile technology for near-real-time data transmission.

- Collaboration with institutions in the United Kingdom and South-East Asia contributed to the improvement of the OH surveillance system. Data collected through CAS and DPS systems are centrally stored and analyzed. The Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) acts as the custodian of this data, sharing reports with relevant ministries and field-based disease management units.

- Ongoing discussions focus on the appropriate model for collecting, storing, and analyzing data from the Kagera River basin, which falls under the East African Community (EAC).","SACIDS' One Health (OH) surveillance approach is well-suited for detecting and managing infectious diseases in resource-constrained countries like those in southern Africa. The use of mobile technologies and effective surveillance methods enhances the timely and comprehensive monitoring of disease events that might be overlooked by conventional systems in both animal and human health sectors. In conclusion, the OH surveillance strategy is highly pertinent and timely for sub-Saharan Africa.","The similarities in disease surveillance structures between animal and human health sectors create opportunities for collaboration. The current system relies on community-based reporters for initial disease detection, with central coordination at the district level. This shared structure enables joint efforts in managing disease epidemics. However, challenges such as delayed reporting and resource constraints affect the effectiveness of surveillance.

The baseline study highlights the need for improved surveillance systems. There is significant variation in surveillance report completeness, with overall poor coverage. Limited human resources and infrastructure contribute to delays in reporting.

In response, the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) has designed a One Health (OH) surveillance strategy tailored to the region's challenges. This strategy, incorporating mobile technologies and participatory approaches, addresses the unique circumstances of southern Africa. The collaborative OH approach is expected to enhance disease surveillance, ultimately benefiting public health and socioeconomic stability in the region.

In conclusion, the SACIDS OH surveillance strategy is well-suited for resource-constrained countries in southern Africa and is deemed timely and relevant for sub-Saharan Africa."

evaluate one health Initiatives",Ruegg et al.,10.3389/fvets.2018.00023,2018,"Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH),One Health (OH)","The paper presents an evaluation framework, developed through the EU COST Action (TD 1404) ""Network for Evaluation of One Health"" (NEOH), for assessing the complex and integrated One Health (OH) initiatives aimed at improving human, animal, and environmental health. The framework consists of four key elements: defining the initiative and its context, describing the theory of change and expected outcomes, evaluating the operational and supporting infrastructures (OH-ness), and assessing the associations between the process evaluation and outcomes. It employs a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative assessments, including an OH-index and OH-ratio to measure the degree of ""OH-ness."" The framework aids researchers and practitioners in conducting evaluations of integrated health approaches, facilitating comparisons across different OH activities and resource allocation decisions. Case studies demonstrating the framework's application are provided for validation and benchmarking purposes.","Objective: The surveillance system aimed to improve the epidemiological understanding and estimate the prevalence and distribution of 15 zoonotic diseases in western Kenya.

Disease Selection: The 15 zoonotic pathogens of interest were selected based on the need to prioritize surveillance for neglected and underreported zoonotic infections, recent research findings, and a prioritization exercise for zoonotic diseases in Kenya.

Population of Interest: The study focused on cattle, small ruminants, and pigs at livestock markets and slaughterhouses/slabs, as well as patients at private and public sector hospitals in the counties of Busia, Bungoma, and Kakamega in western Kenya.

Sampling Design:
- A sampling frame of health facilities, livestock markets, and slaughterhouses/slabs was developed based on interviews with relevant stakeholders.
The selection of sites was based on epidemiological and logistical factors.
- A final sampling scheme included 12 sentinel sites, each comprising a livestock market, neighboring slaughterhouses/slabs, and a hospital.
- Sentinel sites were visited once every 4 weeks for 20 cycles.

Animal and Patient Sampling:
- Up to 10 animals at livestock markets and neighboring slaughterhouses/slabs were sampled during each visit, regardless of their health status.
- At hospitals, up to 10 patients meeting specific inclusion criteria were considered for inclusion on each visit.
- Samples collected included blood, nasal swabs, fecal samples, and external parasites from animals, and blood, nasal swabs, fecal samples, and clinical data from patients.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
- Data were collected electronically on GPS-enabled devices and linked to a secure cloud server.
- Data analyses were conducted separately from the national surveillance databases.
- Laboratory testing of biological samples was performed for the 15 zoonotic diseases of interest.
- Public engagement sessions were conducted at sentinel sites to share preliminary results and raise awareness.

**Ethical Approval:** The study received ethical approval from relevant institutional committees and government authorities.

The methodology aimed to comprehensively sample and analyze zoonotic pathogens in both animals and humans in the study area to improve understanding and inform public health strategies.",,"The NEOH evaluation framework relates the aspects of operations (i.e., One Health (OH) thinking, OH planning, and OH working) and supporting infrastructure summarised as OH process characteristics (“OH-ness”), to changes and outcomes evoked by a specific initiative
