1,INDEX,"Towards a global One Health index: 
a potential assessment tool for One Health 
performance",Zhang et.al,"The international society is rapidly adopting a One Health approach because it promotes holistic thinking by recognising the close linkages and interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health. However, a lack of real-world evidence has impeded the implementation of a One Health strategy in policy and practise. This study suggests the creation of a prospective One Health performance evaluation tool in order to contribute to the scientific measurement of the One Health approach and the identification of gaps where One Health capacity building is most urgently required.","GOHI would be the world's first evaluation tool that develops the conceptual framework of One Health from a holistic perspective. Future applications of GOHI may foster a shared understanding of a strong One Health approach and serve as a model for supporting effective One Health capacity building strategies. GOHI, together with its technological protocols and databases, will be updated on a regular basis to overcome present technical limits and capture new knowledge, with potential modifications under diverse scenarios.","Firstly, the introduction of the cell-like framework of GOHI provides a clear definition and promotes common understanding of the determinants and functioning of a strong One Health approach, which will serve as the conceptual foundation for policy making. Moreover, the GOHI database enhances the consistency and quality of One Health systems, including via collaboration in data transparency and information sharing. Secondly, GOHI is able to serve as a tool for the assessment of the performance of One Health approaches at global, continental, country and sub-regional levels. It provides a means for identifying gaps and promoting the adoption of effective measures to strengthen One Health capacity building in countries/territories where it is needed most. GOHI sets out to distill examples of best practice and guides countries to identify potential weaknesses in One Health implementation. This in turn helps identify priorities for international assistance in One Health issues, which is much needed for poverty alleviation and achievement of the SDGs. Thirdly, the CDI in GOHI focuses on emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, AMR, food security and climate change. All of the countermeasures tackling these global challenges need further development and new technologies, such as surveillance and response technologies, preparedness and early warning systems, prediction and modelling platforms. GOHI aims to support early identification of the gaps in technology development in relevant fields, particularly in the fields of infectious disease control and prevention, emergency response and preparedness and AMR monitoring and control, which are core issues in One Health practice."
2,INDEX,"Global antimicrobial resistance:
a system-wide comprehensive investigation
using the Global One Health Index",Zhou et. Al,"One of the top ten worldwide public health issues is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, given the lack of a complete assessment of global AMR status, our goal is to establish a One Health-based system-wide AMR evaluation tool.",GOHI-AMR is the most complete instrument currently available for assessing AMR status around the world. We uncovered distinct features influencing AMR in each nation and provided specific recommendations to strengthen the capacity of low-ranking countries to combat AMR.,"Consistent with the positive correlation between GOHI-AMR and GDP, GNI, and domestic health expenditures, the HICs significantly outperformed the other three income nation groups, with all five key indicators dramatically above the global average. Particularly for the key indicator ACO, nearly all of the HICs have accounted for the proper use of antibiotics not just in humans but in animals and environments as well. Simultaneously, HICs have numerous existing challenges. Firstly, unexpectedly, in the sub-indicators MR-SA and AR-ABA, the prevalence of MRSA and aminoglycosides-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in HICs are significantly higher than those in LICs but lower than in UMICs and LMICs. Moreover, utilizing AMR surveillance data from ECDC, there are still some HICs, such as Cyprus and Malta, with a higher prevalence of ESKAPE and no effective preventative or control measures, demonstrating that even within HICs, huge AMR discrepancies also exist; Secondly, among the monitoring-related key indicators ASS, less than one-third of HICs scored over 60 on the indicator AMC (antibacterial drug consumption monitoring for humans and animals). The primary issue is the inadequacy of national monitoring of animal antibiotic consumption, with only New Zealand scoring 75 on the sub-indicator ACA. In the future, UMICs, LMICs, and LICs will confront similar AMR challenges."
3,INDEX,"Toward One Health: a spatial 
indicator system to model the 
facilitation of the spread of 
zoonotic diseases",Espino et.al,"The recurrence of zoonotic infectious illnesses emphasises the need of understanding the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health in disease prevention and control. This has given rise to the notion of One Health, which acknowledges the connection of human and animal health within their own ecosystems. The indicators chosen focused on demographics, socioeconomic factors, interactions between animal and human populations, water bodies, and environmental variables such as air quality and climate. These indicators were defined using values collected from the literature or derived using distance analysis, geoprocessing activities, and other techniques.","The considerable positive association between the outcomes of the indicator system and the presence of artificial GI corroborated this tendency. The correlation with natural and semi-natural GI, on the other hand, demonstrated an inverse relationship, emphasising the importance of these regions for habitat preservation and biodiversity protection, thereby harmonising with the concepts of One Health. The veracity of these findings was confirmed by comparing the indicator system results with the records provided in the Valencian Community in 2021, which revealed a strong positive association. As a result, while developing strategies for better public space planning, the indicator system is offered as a tool for implementing the principles of the One Health approach.","The results obtained in this study address some key demands in the field of landscape epidemiology, including the incorporation of spatial interactions between individuals and environmental gradients in large-scale studies. Spatial dimensions such as distances between humans, animals, and environments have been found to be associated with both directly and indirectly transmitted infectious diseases. Overall, the spatial processing of indicators proposed in this study aligns with these premises. The results are also consistent with the notion that urbanization contributes to increased encounters with wildlife, leading to challenges in infectious disease epidemiology due to amplified and faster spread. Although the interface between human and wildlife populations ( I14 ) carries moderate weight, wild animals ( I8) and human population ( I3 ) were identified as the two most important indicators"
4,POLICY," Knowledge integration in One Health policy formulation, 
implementation and evaluation",Hitziger et.al,"One Health is a complex biological and social system involving various actors and processes, as well as their interactions over time at the local, national, and global levels. There is already a framework for global health governance: a collection of formal and informal institutions, rules, and processes that affect global health policy decisions. In an ideal world, such a framework would cross national borders, embrace multisectoral and interdisciplinary approaches, and engage with a diverse variety of important actors. However, the current structure is hampered by the fragmentation of health interests, programmes, and sectors, a general lack of societal participation, and a professional focus on very limited areas of expertise, referred to as professional silos.
The existing framework's dysfunctionality in terms of its basic elements of the One health concept, emphasizes the need for a dedicated framework for One health governance. ","To develop and improve One Health best practises, practitioners and scientists in active One Health networks should be educated on knowledge integration and encouraged to discuss their ideas with those of more established governance actors, ideally through programmes supported by long-term professional associations or organisations. Finally, effort should be focused on establishing and implementing effective technical tools to promote stakeholder participation and brokering at all levels of health governance, from local to global.","Although multicriteria analyses, systems thinking and transdisciplinary 
approaches mainly focus on different, crucial aspects of One Health gover nance, they are complementary and overlapping rather than mutually exclu sive. They provide methods to resolve trade-offs and set a common vision and a common direction across disciplines, 
institutions and sectors. They serve as a toolbox for systemic monitoring and feedback to transform observations into narratives detailing how situa tions emerge and might unfold in the future. Finally, they contribute to the development and/or strengthening of networks for collective action towards a common vision. Potentially, therefore, as a decisive element in policy develop ment, knowledge integration could help resolve the main shortcomings of the current global framework for health governance, by managing complexity and shaping interactions between actors and institutions towards joint learning.

5,POLICY,A socioeconomic approach to one health policy research in southern Africa,Kayunze et.al,"In some countries, one-health approaches to infectious disease control have begun to be used to health systems in order to collaborate lower disease burdens in humans, cattle, and wild animals. However, it is unclear if the problem of persistent and new zoonoses is exacerbated by health policy, a lack of one-health methods, or other causes. The primary goal of this article was to determine which factors influence disease burden and how disease burden affects socioeconomic well-being. A review of the literature reveals, among other things, that the occurrence of infectious diseases in humans and animals is influenced by a variety of factors, the most important of which are the causative agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) and the mediator conditions (social, cultural, economic, or climatic) which facilitate the infection to occur and hold. ","The natural sciences are greatest at understanding the causal agents, while the social sciences are best at understanding the mediating circumstances. As a result, a research framework that recognises the role that socio-economists can play in collaborating with biological scientists to harness innovation in science and technology in order to improve the capacity to detect, identify, and monitor infectious diseases of humans and animals, as well as their interactions, in order to better manage the risk posed by them, is more likely to provide the type of evidence-based policy impact. The One Health approach appears to be the most sensible solution. However, one should not underestimate the limitations posed by contemporary organisational systems, even in the case of the shared problem of zoonoses between animal and human health.",
6,POLICY,"Integrating a One Health approach into
epidemiology to improve public policy",Kahn et.al,"To develop effective disease prevention strategies, public policies rely on robust epidemiological data. The notion of One Health, which links human, animal, environmental, and ecosystem health, provides a valuable framework for exploring, assessing, and managing complicated relationships between multiple health concerns such as antimicrobial resistance.
","A One Health strategy demands more communication and collaboration among epidemiologists, veterinarians, and physicians, among others. Companion animals, livestock, and, if practicable, wildlife should all be included in antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems. To make this vital disease prevention strategy a reality, establishing a One Health approach to epidemiological investigations that integrates human, animal, environmental, and ecosystem health will require political will and dedicated finances.",
7,POLICY,Integrating one health in national health policies of developing countries: India’s lost opportunities,Chatterjee et.al ,"Globally, health systems have been caught off guard by the threat of infectious disease, especially emerging infectious diseases that originate at the human-animal-environment interface. With predictions that future pathogen emergence will be concentrated in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, it is critical to develop policy frameworks to tackle this threat.","Adopting One Health initiatives in health and related sectoral policies is an important policy imperative for India and other emerging countries. The goal should be to not only develop preparedness strategies, but also to foster a policy climate in which the assessment and mitigation of the downstream effects of various agendas are embraced.",
8,FRAMEWORK,One Health operations: a critical component in the International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework,Rocque et.al,"Countries are expected to develop their capacity to detect, assess, inform, and respond to unusual health incidents of possible international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), a legally binding treaty adopted by 196 States Parties. The World Health Organisation (WHO) developed the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (IHR MEF) to assist nations in monitoring, strengthening, and complying with the IHR (2005).
The State Party Annual Report, the Joint External Evaluation, after-action reviews, and simulation exercises are all complementing components of this structure. The first two are intended to review capacities, while the latter two are used to assist explore their functionality. The input of various disciplines, sectors, and areas of work collaborating through a One Health approach is critical for execution.","Since their implementation in 2005, the IHR have assisted the world community in better preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. Many States Parties have made significant progress in developing and strengthening the essential capacities mandated by the Regulations. Taking use of the present momentum and existing initiatives that encourage Regulations implementation, the IHR MEF assists countries in their efforts to create and sustain core capacities and ensure their full integration into national health systems. Furthermore, the IHR MEF assists countries in continuing to incorporate other key sectors, including as animal health, the environment, travel, and transportation. ",
9,FRAMEWORK,"One Health operational framework for action for the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region, focusing on zoonotic diseases ",Mahrous et.al,"The Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organisation, like any other region, faces the threat of new and resurfacing zoonoses. However, given a lack of resources, weak health systems, and political factors, the problems in this Region are significant. As a result, embracing the One Health concept becomes critical in order to aid those countries. Following that, a framework for action towards effectively implementing the One Health approach was designed based on an examination of One Health capacity in the Region and extensive collaboration with representatives and subject matter experts from nations in the Region. The framework capitalises on present possibilities in the region and provides countries with a list of practical essential tasks aimed at making the most use of their resources and developing their capacity to deal with current and future challenges. Building on current processes and establishing strong governance structures are critical for attaining efficient disease surveillance and response. Furthermore, employing intersectoral approaches for risk assessment and risk mitigation for health issues at the human-animal-environment interface might increase efficiency and yield better results.
","The Region is committed to continuing to provide technical assistance to regional countries in order to establish a multisectoral collaboration and coordination mechanism among their professionals in the human health, animal health, and environmental sectors, as well as to assisting countries in developing national plans to meet their obligations under the International Health Regulations (2005). Furthermore, the Region will organise and arrange technical expert meetings across nations to discuss lessons learned and inter-regional experience.",
10,FRAMEWORK,"Strategic planning, components and evolution 
in zoonotic diseases frameworks: one health approach 
and public health ethics",Ghanbari et.al,"Zoonotic illnesses are regarded as a major public health risk. 
The routes of rapid transmission of zoonotic illnesses, as well as the economic damage they do to populations, are all reasons why health organisations and systems should pay more attention to these diseases. Strategic planning is an important duty for policymakers in any organisation or system. It is a very dependable and effective instrument for running all types of organisations, including health care organisations. Countries with well-defined policies have been successful in controlling and lowering zoonotic illnesses. Such countries employed appropriate strategic planning and set annual goals for illness control and prevention.
","In order to improve their ability to battle zoonotic infections, health systems must adopt strategic plans. These programmes must be adaptable, consistent with the one health strategy, based on current requirements, and connected with the emerging difficulties confronting health systems. The strategic planning of each country's health system is strongly tied to national and international policies, organisational goals and missions, dynamism, degree of complexity, and organisational structure. 
As a result, we suggest that the above-mentioned components should be identified and included when establishing a robust strategy plan for zoonotic diseases. ",
11,GOVERNANCE,"Editorial: One health,
environmental health, global
health, and inclusive
governance: What can we do?", Laaser et.al,"""One Health"" is a comprehensive conceptual framework that includes a global perspective on human and animal health, as well as the environment, which includes air, water, soil, and plants. It necessitates combining interactions from both the bottom-up and top-down perspectives, based in inclusive government , and supported by interactive science, i.e., cross-disciplinary scientific collaboration. At the ground level, what is done in practise must affect those in power, resulting in more responsive, effective, and inclusive government and, as a result, significantly improved outcomes. Human and veterinary medicine, public health, social sciences, educators, and lawmakers must be involved and contribute to national and local decisions and actions.","Despite their potential, these strategies have limitations. The current trajectory cannot be changed solely by the global North; effective international cooperation will be vital. Physicians and veterinarians are important professions that cannot change the current patterns on their own, and contributions from the social and political sciences are critical for successfully implementing change. To summarise, the gap between bottom-up and top-down, grassroots and organised action, must be addressed by all of us.",
12,GOVERNANCE,"Addressing Inequalities Toward
Inclusive Governance for Achieving
One Health: A Rapid Review", Eliakimu and Mans,"Aims to identify key issues that are likely to exacerbate inequalities around the six SDGs directly related to One Health, namely SDGs 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, and 15, and to suggest some actions that may help to address them using inclusive governance in light of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). Informed by the literature on SDGs and using Gupta and Vegelin's ""inclusive development concept,"" a literature search was conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed Central, and the search of references in relevant articles identified using search terms from the six SDGs that are directly related to One Health. In the context of the SDGs, the following must be accomplished in order to attain One Health through inclusive governance and address inequalities: The notion of the antibiotic resistome was presented just over a decade ago, and active resistome investigations have been carried out since then. In this paper, we describe the previously established concept of the resistome, which includes all types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as well as key findings from each One-Health sector that take this concept into account, emphasising the importance of the One-Health approach in understanding ARG transmission. Cutting-edge research approaches are required to unravel the complex resistome structure in human, animal, and environmental microbiomes. Future directions for resistome research have been recommended to better the understanding and control of ARG transmission based on previous achievements of resistome studies in several One-Health sectors: a ranking of the most important ARGs and their hosts; increasing number of armed conflicts; ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; ensuring availability of water and sanitation facilities; improving city and urban areas climate change planning; improving governance arrangements for addressing climate change factoring gender and human rights; multisectoral planning for conservation of oceans, seas, and marine resources; balancing wildlife trade regulation with conservation efforts; need for a research collaborative It is also vital to include people with impairments in the usage of digital technologies.
","Inequalities have a global, regional, and national impact on people's health and well-being. An inclusive approach to government has the ability to include everyone and hence minimise inequities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has worsened inequality and its drivers, putting our attempts to reduce inequities through the One Health strategy under strain. While we have identified several critical initiatives to alleviate inequities in regard to the six SDGs directly relevant to One Health, they will need to be backed up by strong policies at the global, regional, and country levels that are informed by policy sciences. It also necessitates increased country capacity for undertaking research on health disparities. As a result, we advocate for inclusive governance in addressing inequities in order to attain One Health.","In the context of the SDGs, in order to achieve One Health through inclusive governance, and tackle inequalities, the following need to be addressed: armed conflicts; ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; availability of water and sanitation facilities; improving city and urban areas planning; improving governance arrangements for addressing effects of climate change factoring gender and human rights; multisectoral planning for conservation of marine resources; balancing trade regulation wildlife trade with conservation efforts; research collaborative involving experts from environmental sciences, wildlife, agriculture and human health to study and develop scientific evidence on contribution of changes in land use practices to occurrence of zoonotic diseases; and need for a legislation for promoting animal welfare to protect public health."
13,GOVERNANCE,"Evaluating One Health: the role of team science
in multisectoral collaboration",Errecaborde et.al,"Many individual disciplines, and in some cases multidisciplinary research teams, have looked at the scholarship of collaboration and arrived at remarkably similar conclusions about which factors and competencies support effective collaboration in a review of the literature surrounding One Health, cross-boundary collaboration, the science of teams, and interdisciplinary health competencies. However, findings on how to evaluate collaboration effectively are frequently lacking in the research studied. Despite recent gains in measuring One Health operations and outcomes, there remains an opportunity to develop process-based performance indicators for One Health collaboration and teamwork. The authors believe that, in addition to outcome-based One Health, work on collaborative performance evaluation should be synthesised across several disciplinary and sectoral lanes and degrees of collaborative analysis.","The increase in the number of global frameworks and their success Stories published and/or acknowledged throughout the recent decade, and especially in the last few years, create a firm foundation. universal dedication and confidence in the intrinsic worth of the One Health and a collaborative approach. However, there is more work to be done, including additional research explains how to best form and support teams can effectively implement transdisciplinary techniques. In this examination of collaborative scholarship's disciplinary'lanes' Through investigation, the authors discovered four fundamental factors that can assist us move forward in our evaluation of One Health. The irony is that the collective 'we' is required to work more efficiently across disciplines to help collaboration research and evaluation of collaborative efforts in the field.","In this brief review of the literature, the authors have synthesised lessons from five comprehensive literature reviews to illustrate the depth of collaborative scholarship available to guide the One Health community. While not exhaustive, it provides a window into the depth of collaborative research available across various disciplines, as well as suggesting the commonality in the characteristics reported and the competencies developed to support effective collaboration. Recognising the work that NEOH has begun, this article supports the need for continued progress on evaluating One Health on two fronts: individual metrics (e.g. economic benefit) used for specific projects that provide ‘proof of concept’ for One Health, and the measurement of collaborative processes or teamwork effectiveness. The absence of a process by which practitioners can evaluate teaming remains a critical gap in the development of successful One Health projects, programmes, initiatives or networks. It is important to stress that there is much to leverage and learn from the literature on team science, cross-boundary collaboration and interdisciplinary work when considering when and how to evaluate One Health."
14,GOVERNANCE,Adopting an intersectoral One Health approach in India,Rajib et.al,"Following many outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Indian policy initiatives are committed to institutionalising One Health (OH) concepts and promoting intersectoral, transdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation. The OH principle must be visualised outside of the context of zoonoses. While the conservation, ecological, and veterinary professions are becoming more involved in OH, the majority of the medical/clinical and social sciences professions are only dimly aware of its subtleties. Because of their basically multidisciplinary nature, the OH efforts include collaborating across ministries, overcoming tacit institutional hierarchies, and allocating leadership roles. The formation of One Health Committees (OHC) at the state and district levels will be the next obvious operational step.","The importance of solid sectoral systems cannot be overstated, as they will determine operational elements in the end. Academic institutions will have a significant impact in shaping and facilitating OH education. Capacity development should thus concentrate on cross-cutting concerns such as zoonotic illnesses that are currently affecting communities, public health, environmental degradation/climate change, economics, risk assessment and surveillance, and policy development. It is hoped that these stages will lead to the establishment of ""OH community"" networks and the promotion of the idea of ""Oneness.""",

16,GOVERNANCE,"One Health collaborations for zoonotic disease 
control in Ethiopia",Murphy et.al,"Because of the nature of their transmission between animals and people, zoonotic diseases necessitate a One Health approach for successful control and elimination. One Health recognises the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health. Ethiopia has committed to using a One Health approach to control five priority zoonotic diseases (rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis). The National One Health Steering Committee (NOHSC) offers national stakeholders with a framework for addressing gaps in multisectoral communication, coordination, and collaboration. Furthermore, the NOHSC directs the development of many specialty disease-focused groups known as 'Technical Working Groups' (TWGs). These TWGs are in charge of creating disease preventive and control strategies, as well as carrying out illness-focused public health activities and making recommendations to the NOHSC.","Creating and sustaining multisectoral, One Health collaborations necessitates regular, coordinated, and devoted efforts from numerous partners who may not ordinarily collaborate on a daily basis. Over the last few years, there has been a tremendous increase in awareness and collaboration as a result of a better knowledge of the essential role that zoonotic diseases play in Ethiopia's agricultural infrastructure and public health. The One Health approach's continued support will be contingent on sustained national support to improve the NOHSC and associated TWGs, as well as the availability of public and animal health specialists to direct training and respond to future disease risks.",
17,GOVERNANCE,International law reform for One Health notifications,Carlson et.al,"Rapid information sharing is essential for assessing and responding to epidemic risks. We explore the limits of the current system for outbreak notifications, which suffers from vague requirements, brittle incentives, and an unduly narrow focus on human outbreaks, using instances from the last decade. We evaluate existing international legal frameworks and provide clarity on what would be required for a successful One Health approach to suggested international law reforms, such as a pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations. We focus on how a treaty could simultaneously expand reporting obligations, accelerate the sharing of scientific discoveries, and strengthen existing legal frameworks, all while addressing the most complex issues confronting global health governance today.","The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body for the Pandemic Treaty will meet in June 2022 to discuss the drafting of treaty draughts. In the meantime, proposed IHR amendments are being investigated by the Working Group on IHR Amendments, and will be debated in the 75th World Health Assembly in May 2022. We are in a rare period of political momentum in which we can address the delays and data governance shortcomings of the current fragmented collection of notification instruments and institutions. 
International legislation reform has the ability to actualize and cohere around a One Health approach, potentially preventing the next outbreak from becoming a pandemic. It would also begin to establish a global health infrastructure capable of successfully sharing information outside of the country.",
18,GOVERNANCE,Meanings and mechanisms of One Health partnerships: insights from a critical review of literature on cross-government collaborations,Abbas et.al,"Antimicrobial resistance and other emerging illnesses are complex health policy concerns generated by actions in several sectors.
As a result, tackling issues needs collaborative efforts from many sectors, as represented by the One Health concept. We conduct a critical assessment to analyse the many ways in which multisector partnerships have been conceptualised across multiple disciplines and thematic areas. We began with a collection of six articles from the disciplines of health, nutrition, and public administration that addressed conceptual frameworks in their respective professions. We used the bibliography of the six works to do backward citation tracing to locate other articles in the same and related fields that conceptualised multisector collaborations. Multisector collaborations occur in times of dynamic uncertainty and sector failure, when the information and resources needed exceed the capacities of any single sector. Such collaborations are fundamentally political in nature, as they encompass many opposing goals of partnering actors. To sustain cooperation over time, collaborative methods such as One Health will need to accept different political positions and contain flexibility to allow multisector partnerships to adjust to changing external circumstances.","Instead of disregarding politics, a successful partnership must be savvy about working with and tolerating it. We urge that researchers investigate the impact of politics in influencing multisector collaborations and that technical agencies provide guidance on One Health partnerships that is explicit about the political agenda in which they function. Rather than standardised approaches, we propose that international One Health guidelines should build capacities and empower national programme managers to be flexible in selecting a form of One Health that best meets their needs and can accommodate the agendas of different collaborating actors within their respective political landscapes. We believe that if the One Health movement can accept and support such an adaptive and flexible strategy, we will be more likely to succeed.","We have structured the Discussion section in three parts.
The first part discusses possible typologies of multisector col laborations. The second part examines possible drivers of
multisector collaborations informed by a complex system
understanding of collaborations. The last part draws upon the

19,GOVERNANCE,"Global and regional governance of One Health and 
implications for global health security", Elnaiem et.al,"The apparent inability of global health security to avoid or prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of greater collaboration between the human, animal (domestic and wildlife), and environmental health sectors. 
However, the numerous institutions, processes, regulatory frameworks, and legal instruments involved in the global governance of One Health have resulted in a fragmented, global, multilateral health security architecture. 
We investigate four challenges: first, the sectoral, professional, and institutional silos and tensions that exist between human, animal, and environmental health; second, the challenge that the international legal system, state sovereignty, and existing legal instruments pose for the governance of One Health; third, the power dynamics and asymmetry in power between countries represented in multilateral institutions and their impact on priority setting; and fourth, the power dynamics and asymmetry in power between countries represented in multilateral institutions and their impact on priority setting.","Our recommendations outline mechanisms for addressing the inequality that is currently built into the global multilateral system, such as leveraging nonhealth treaties in the trade and environmental sectors to achieve positive externalities in health, or using regional bodies to share responsibility and investment commitments without sacrificing locally responsive processes. However, for these systems to be successful, significant investment in capacity building in the technical, legal, and political domains is required into the practise of One Health. Above all, promises should be concrete, aggressive, and based on equity, and sustained. They should represent in their social-ecological system the very real threat that hazards across the whole socioeconomic spectrum provide, both in terms of causing and exacerbating global health catastrophes, and in terms of weakening the resilience of all living species.",
20,GOVERNANCE,"Factors that enable effective One Health
collaborations - A scoping review of the
literature",Errecaborde et. Al,"One Health advocates recognise that global health concerns necessitate multidisciplinary collaboration efforts. While previous articles examined interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few identified the variables and situations that enable operational One Health. A multidisciplinary team of researchers conducted a scoping analysis of the literature, analysing peer-reviewed papers describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health crises. The study discovered that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not consistently report on collaboration's accomplishments or problems and rarely identify collaborative outputs or outcomes.","When active cooperation is not structurally supported, recognised, and continually checked for health and effectiveness, different approaches can be a substantial barrier. Our efforts highlight the importance of training for skill sets that go beyond technical sector-specific training. When considering which abilities were most important in our collaborative process, we discovered that the common goal of cooperation was the foundation for our ability to incorporate the diverse expertise that each team member brought to the process. Most of the time, like in our case, it is an ad hoc process that is dependent on the incentives, shared values, and time available within a team to develop in this manner. According to our findings, while this strategy worked for us, it would not work for you. Our study reveals that, while this technique worked for us, it would be inefficient in terms of time and resources in the event of a health emergency. Thus, One Health techniques must be reviewed to assist practitioners in determining when and how to interact most successfully for their intended aims.",
21,TECHNOLOGY,Real-time genomics for One Health,Urban et. Al,"While the notion of One Health illustrates how human health and environmental health are closely intertwined, many of these complex interdependencies remain unknown. We demonstrate how the introduction of real-time genomic analyses can enhance One Health and enable fast, in-depth ecosystem health assessments in this paper.  We present nanopore sequencing as the sole disruptive technology that now allows for real-time genomic studies and is being used globally to improve the accessibility and adaptability of genomic sequencing.  We highlight real-time genomic studies on zoonotic disease, food security, environmental microbiome, emerging pathogens and their antimicrobial resistances, and environmental health itself--from the creation of genomic resources for wildlife conservation to the monitoring of biodiversity, invasive species, and wildlife trafficking.","The application of real-time genomic technologies at the point-of-care can improve our understanding of complex interdependencies within the One Health concept, directly informing management decisions in clinical, veterinary, agricultural, conservation, and environmental applications.To truly achieve fair and universal adoption of real-time genomics, a paradigm shift is required. To promote decentralised capacity, this will require addressing global disadvantages and making the technology commercializable and compatible with varied cultural models and infrastructure. Further research and automation are necessary to make the device more accessible, allowing it to be used at airports, hospitals, isolated wildlife camps, local populations, or in daily conservation and biosecurity surveillance. This global and decentralised genetic data has the prospect of broadening our horizons.",
22,TECHNOLOGY,"A One Health approach to managing the 
applications and implications of nanotechnologies 
in agriculture",Lombi et.al,"As continued developments in nanotechnology are swiftly converted into new industrial applications and nano-enabled commercial products, the need for adequate science and legislation to underpin nanosafety is greater than ever. Nonetheless, there remains a gap between those investigating the implications of nanoparticles to human and environmental health. This gap is not uncommon in research and risk assessment, and it has been exacerbated in the case of designed nanomaterials by the relatively limited overlap in human and environmental exposure pathways. The emergence of agri-nanotechnologies increases both the need and the possibility to change this status quo, since it poses important challenges of intersectionality that current discipline-specific approaches cannot fully address.

Nanotechnology provides an exciting platform for solving this issue. Nanoparticles have distinct qualities that make them extremely successful in treating bacterial infections by reducing the growth and survival of multidrug-resistant bacteria in three domains of health: human, animal, and environmental. In order to conduct an economic evaluation of surveillance in this environment, it is critical to first understand the links that must be addressed by different nations through the implementation of national action programmes based on the One Health strategy.","Antibiotics are the cornerstones of modern medicine and have considerably contributed to the improvement of health care, but when AMR spread, it presented a global threat to human life that had not previously existed. As a result, a nanotechnology-based drug delivery system for the production of future nanobiotics is viewed as a weapon in the twenty-first-century technological revolution, achieved by constructing a governance structure that aligns strategic and operational planning with a single health approach. This provides hope that the detrimental impacts of antimicrobial resistance can be mitigated and that the repercussions for society as a whole will not be irreversible.

This includes taking actions to ensure the sustained effectiveness of existing antimicrobials by minimising inappropriate use and restricting illness transmission. In the human sector, it is critical to avoid infections, limit antimicrobial overuse, enhance sanitation, and improve hygiene and infection control. Improvements in antimicrobial usage legislation and policy, surveillance, stewardship, infection control, sanitation, animal husbandry, and antimicrobial alternatives are all necessary efforts. ","With the exception of new antimicrobial classes, history has demonstrated that it is not possible to neatly separate antimicrobial classes into those that are exclusively for use in people or animals. These should generally only be used in humans if there are few or no alternatives. The majority of classes, however, will be available for use in both sectors, and One Health's challenge will be to guarantee that the overall usage of these drugs is optimal. This is more likely to occur when antimicrobials used in both sectors are used for therapy rather than prophylaxis and never for growth promotion, and when we better manage the types and amounts of antimicrobials used, as well as the number of resistant bacteria that we allow to be placed into the environment. ",

Cutting-edge research approaches are required to unravel the complex resistome structure in human, animal, and environmental microbiomes.

Although there have been moments when medical practitioners and veterinarians have collaborated in the past, it may be too broad to assume that such collaboration was typical. Indeed, one of the reasons Rudolf Virchow strove for ""one medicine"" (later described as One Health) in the nineteenth century was a lack of collaboration between doctors and veterinarians. The twentieth century, however, brought more isolation and separation between these two domains of research. Given the current accelerated global development, collaborative efforts and durable partnerships in a specific area should contribute to consistent strengths in order to provide meaningful findings, with direct applications in the areas studied and into the communities.
","While the One Health approach is widely regarded as critical for addressing complex governance challenges and is widely supported in theory, its implementation in practise remains limited, owing to a lack of financial support and a secular anthropogenic and self-centered mentality.
Overall, the world must continue to work to establish a uniform system of equal health assessment, as well as to build long-term procedures for collaboration and communication among relevant organisations and ministries for human, plant, and animal health. In addition, link national, regional, and international strategies with collaboration, cooperation, and intersectoral partnership in order to put the concept of environmental conservation into practise on a daily basis.

was found to be low, and most of them expressed a feel ing of “burnout” in their current schedule, which needs 
to be accounted for during the implementation of any 
health programs. Tere were several advantages of pro moting FHWs to future OHAs at the community level

SOE (46%), followed by those scored as low (29%), and high (25%), with none scored as
insufficient. While all studies were interdisciplinary, the majority included in the review
incorporated all three One Health sectors (54%), followed by those involving animals and
people (33%), and studies involving people and the environment (13%). As the search
focused on indigenous communities, studies with a focus on animals and the environment
only were unlikely to be identified which may have limited studies that incorporated an
environmental health component. When broken down by SOE, 71% of studies scored as
low included all three One Health sectors, compared to 45% of studies scored as moderate,
and 50% of studies scored as high. Undertaking studies that incorporate all three sectors
can be more complex compared to those which focus on two sectors only; however, they
can also be more beneficial.
While the One Health concept commonly aims for interdisciplinary research, and
this evidence base has demonstrated this, One Health within indigenous communities
should strive for transdisciplinary research which takes a whole-of-society approach,
values the inclusion of local community members, and prioritizes benefiting indigenous
peoples. While the concept has been supported by international health organizations,
the practicalities of enacting it can be multifaceted and further consideration on how to
truly implement the concept is needed [10]. The ownership and collaboration required
between sectors can be a contested point, with many health sectors working within silos
and limited examples of truly interdisciplinary work being operationalized and reported.

Safe food improves people's health and productivity while also laying the groundwork for development and poverty eradication. Every year, many people in industrialised countries are affected by foodborne infections, whereas widespread illness is considerably more prevalent in developing countries. The health risks caused by microbiological infections and chemicals in food are among society's biggest worries.

",Douphrate et.al,"According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, One Health is a multidisciplinary endeavour to achieve optimal health for humans, animals, and the environment. The One Health idea acknowledges that human health is inextricably linked to the health of animals and the environment. Within the One Health framework, livestock operation productivity and efficiency entail a slew of interactions including the animal, equipment, and environment, as well as the person. ","Dairy businesses rely on hired people from various cultural/linguistic origins with varying skill sets, education, and training. The industry is recognising that more focus should be placed on the design and delivery of good livestock handling training for farm personnel. The industry is coming to terms with the fact that worker and cow safety are not mutually exclusive. Animal wellbeing is the consequence of people correctly interacting with animals, which necessitates understanding and anticipating animal behaviour and responses to various stressors. Incorrect human behaviour near animals can endanger both animal and worker safety. ",
49,FOOD SECURITY,Food safety in fisheries: Application of One Health approach,Vergis et.al,"Fisheries are the fastest growing sector, fulfilling the world's protein needs. Because it is a low-cost operation, it is regarded as a safe source of food, and the muscles of healthy fish are nearly sterile. However, throughout the production and supply chain, a plethora of risks (biological, chemical, and environmental) can be introduced into aquaculture. It can also be caused by improper farming practises, environmental contamination, and socio-cultural behaviours prevalent in different places. As a result, with a growing worldwide population and demand for aquacultural products, the assessment and regulation of food safety risks is becoming increasingly important. It is challenging to ensure safe, secure, inexpensive, and high-quality food for all in a global society. In this setting, understanding the ecology and dynamics of these dangers along the entire production chain in a One Health approach is critical. In this section, we explore the concerns and challenges confronting the fisheries sector as a whole, as well as the necessity for a One Health strategy to overcome such obstacles.","Taking cues from this approach and past successes in other domains such as zoonotic infections, it is imperative to instill an OH approach in food safety, particularly in the fisheries sector, with the ultimate goal of achieving health and well-being for humans, co-existing non-humans, and their communal environment for achieving planetary health.
","Seafood being one of the most merchandized global 
supplies, the unaccounted international burdens of 
socio-economic practices require special consideration 
within the aquaculture enterprise. The achievement of 
success metrics in the aquaculture sector at national 
levels, together with the international collaboration 
would form a firm foundation for the adoption of OH
principles in practice. 
 The food safety has now become a pressing and 
burning global issue. Hence, stakeholders from diverse 
domains (government agencies, industry experts, 
researchers, academicians, and the community) should 
involve themselves to simplify the food systems to 
uncouple the public health benefits of consuming
good quality aquatic protein sources from adverse 
impacts on the environment, organism, and the society. 
Integration of good aquacultural practices with the 
existing regulations may deliver encouraging impacts. 
The convergence of various sectors in a holistic pattern 
under ‘One Health umbrella’ would facilitate increased 
production of aquaculture species for effective food
production and sustainable environmental footprints

It explains how different views are interconnected by using examples of food pathogen/food commodity combinations, antibiotic resistance dissemination in the food web, and the danger of transmission of zoonotic infections in a circular system. The examples chosen all demonstrate the complexity of the food system and the importance of a One Health approach. Food safety resources should be targeted where they will have the greatest impact on One Health. Data on illness prevalence and burden, as well as information of source attribution, are critical in appraising the costs and benefits of control interventions. Future gains in food safety, public health, and welfare will be heavily influenced by how well politicians, researchers, industry, and government authorities work together.","Future food safety, public health, and welfare achievements in Europe will be mainly determined by how well politicians, researchers, industry, national agencies, and other stakeholders interact.

52,ETHICS,One Health as a moral dilemma: Towards a socially responsible zoonotic disease control,Herten et.al,"Although a technique could be part of a One Health approach, it is unclear how this helps to the health of the animals in question. As a result, these practises frequently spark public controversy. This begs the question of how we should comprehend the One Health idea in the context of zoonotic disease control. Is it truly about enhancing the health of humans, animals, and the environment on an equal footing, and is this even possible? Isn't it ultimately just public health that matters? The lack of a general definition of the One Health concept adds to the difficulty in times of conflict between diverse ideals. Although boundary objects have many beneficial qualities, this idea appears to mask underlying normative disparities in the context of One Health and zoonotic disease control. To resolve moral quandaries associated with a One Health strategy to zoonotic disease control, it is necessary to consider moral status as well as the meaning of health for humans, animals, and the environment.
","The purpose of One Health should be to strive for a relatively stable balance in which human, animal, and environmental health can be described as resilient. Furthermore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of resilience will allow us to enhance the health of humans, animals, and the environment through prevention rather than cure. Given human domination over animals and ecosystems, this is no easy feat. Even if people are given a special moral position, the One Health idea, if taken seriously, will determine frontiers. Ample space for animals and the environment implies less space for humans to use animals and the environment solely as resources.",
53,ETHICS,Biothreat & One Health: Current scenario & way forward,Kotwal and Yadav,"Humans, animals, and the environment are becoming more interconnected, and the current epidemic has demonstrated the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health. This interconnectedness, as well as variables such as population growth, migration, urbanisation, and climate change, all contribute considerably to the increased likelihood of previously undiscovered wildlife source diseases emerging at any time, at any place, and without notice. The vast potential for the deliberate deployment of biological agents as weapons by State or non-State groups looms in the background. Biological weapons have been employed in warfare since antiquity; however, current research and tactics have made these actual threats with a wide range of potential harm to humans, animals, and crops. It has grown increasingly difficult to distinguish between planned and natural biothreat situations over time. The approach to both sorts is the same: save lives, cattle, crops, and the environment while minimising the socioeconomic consequences. Biothreats can be directed towards humans, animals, or crops, or all three at the same time. Every country, including India, is vulnerable to biothreats. As a result, the concept of one health is critical for reacting to emerging infectious diseases or biothreats. Comprehensive surveillance for early identification, reporting, and coordinated action are required for the prevention and mitigation of biothreats, which necessitate strong cooperation and collaboration among numerous stakeholders both within and outside of each country. ","The probability of biothreat, whether natural or intentional, exists. Newer molecular techniques and technological advancements might serve as both possibilities and barriers. The One Health concept, which recognises the relationship between human, animal, and plant health and the effect of disease on food sources and the economy, would improve early identification, mitigation, and response. A One Health approach with improved coordination, trans-disciplinary and multisectoral actions for designing and implementing policies, programmes, and legislation based on basic and applied research, coupled with effective surveillance systems, early detection, and actions to contain outbreaks of local / national / international concern, as well as rapid and transparent information sharing with increased global cooperation and participation, would have a positive impact.

Fungi are also to blame for significant agricultural product and stored crop losses, as well as recent massive and unexpected animal mortality caused by white-nose sickness in bats and Chytridiomycosis in frogs. This review intends to highlight the importance of a collaborative, multi-sectoral, and trans-disciplinary strategy that includes the One Health concept as an essential component of global emerging fungal disease surveillance, prevention, and control.
","Fungal infections are more common than previously thought, due in part to missed diagnoses, in part to new risk factors, and in part to the introduction of new and multidrug resistant organisms. Fungal allergic illness is also rather frequent, as is exposure in water-damaged structures. The last decade saw significant advances in commercialised, easy, and low-cost diagnostic tests that can alter the lives of those affected by chronic illness. The routine use of these diagnostics will reduce needless anti-bacterial therapy and help to manage AMR. Restriction of azole fungicide usage in agriculture could reduce the growth of resistant Aspergillus, which is significant as azole antifungals become more widely used for fungal asthma and prophylaxis.

This interconnectedness underscores the need for a One Health approach to battle fungal illnesses and overcome antifungal resistance, ensuring that treatment and prevention are both effective.","Natural antifungal controls, such as microbes with antifungal properties or resource competition among microbes, are examples of One Health strategies. Other examples include the integration of environmental surveillance and tracking of evolution to inform clinical prescriptions and use of antifungals specific to a geographical region, as well as drug synergy and repurposing to improve antifungal efficacy and rapidly advance promising alternative therapies to the clinic. Another significant One Health solution is the goal of reversing antifungal resistance through the identification of important drug targets (e.g., transporters, efflux pumps), stress responses, and virulence factors, which support an anti-virulence approach to limit the selection pressure driving resistance.

Because NTD transmission is influenced both directly and indirectly by sociocultural, economic, anthropological, and ecological factors, a One Health approach is critical to addressing all of these elements and providing a framework for collaboration between healthcare services, veterinary public health services, and environmental protection programmes, such as safe water and basic sanitation.",
71,,"Emerging Infectious Diseases and One Health: Implication for
Public Health
",Chen et. Al,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are defined as diseases that have recently been identified, introduced, or evolved; or diseases that have recently and rapidly changed in incidence or geographic, host, or vector range agents; or previous infections that have acquired new virulence factors; or infections that have spread to unaffected regions. Changes in the environment, changes in human behaviour, and the rise of antibiotic resistance are all factors related with the emergence of these pathogenic organisms.
","To summarise, EIDs pose a significant future challenge. The One Health concept is a global plan that acknowledges that public health includes human health, animal health, and environmental health. The One Health approach can improve information for developing effective EID prevention and control approaches. By strengthening existing EIDs surveillance and preventive measures, the construction of an efficient early warning system using the One Health approach will reduce the economic impact of EIDs. Future research should consider factors such as humans, animals, and the environment to gain a better understanding of the complex nature of EID transmission and to improve EID prevention and control techniques. We hope that this issue may shed light on the many components.",
72,,Quantitative Outcomes of a One Health approach to Study Global Health Challenges,Falzon et.al ,"The One Health project, which has gained traction in the recent decade, proposes a holistic approach to addressing complicated global health concerns. However, before suggesting its implementation to stakeholders, it is critical to first gather quantitative proof of the benefits of such an approach. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and summarise primary literature that describes monetary and non-monetary results after implementing a One Health approach. The majority of research found good or partially positive results. This study highlights the diversity of health concerns that may be addressed utilising a One Health strategy, as well as real quantitative measurements that can be used to evaluate future One Health implementations.
","This evaluation lists a number of research that may not have incorporated OH nomenclature but have used an OH approach. Furthermore, this is the first time that the quantitative outcomes of OH studies have been reported collectively, which could give an additional resource for policymakers to use in future OH research investigations. Future work should concentrate on researching the grey literature for more similar studies and harmonising the parameters used to measure the efficacy of treatments across all OH investigations.

73,,One Health approaches to improve refugee health,,"According to 2020 predictions, there are around 264 million refugees worldwide today, with the refugee population growing over the last decade. The evolving situation in Afghanistan following the US withdrawal is likely to increase the number of people forcibly displaced. The process of travel might expose refugees to disease risk factors and impede access to basic health care. Furthermore, refugees are frequently at a disadvantage in comparison to host communities due to xenophobia and a lack of unified support in their host country.

","Other therapies can be developed through additional research, which is based on improved surveillance, data analytics, bioinformatics, and metagenomics, and can provide insights into disease dynamics as well as ethical and evidence-based interventions. 
Taken together, we believe that One Health approaches could give an opportunity to address refugee health concerns by taking into account not just human characteristics, but also animal and environmental considerations in these communities.

74,,"One Health Evaluation: A Case Study
at the University of Bologna",Aragrande et.al,"The degree of One Health (OH-ness) refers to the ability of a project (of a team, an initiative) to materially operate according to six parameters that determine how well it adheres to the One Health (OH) concept. These aspects characterise the sufficiency of OH operations (that is, thinking, planning, and functioning) and OH infrastructures (that is, information exchange, reciprocal learning, and systemic organisation). To meet and deal with the health concerns that come from the interplay of humans, animals, and the environment, the OH concept demands system vision , interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. Over the years, the OH method has gained growing attention.
","The examined Unibo Team activities are distinct from those that will be developed later in the ELEPHANT project; as a result, the future evaluation will present a dynamic portrayal of the projected outcomes inside the ELEPHANT project in its partner institutions. This will be an opportunity for each team to reflect and improve in preparation for the widespread deployment of OH as a concept and a philosophy. To date, no such review has been conducted in academic institutions, only in OH programmes or initiatives with OH-related reach and breadth.
