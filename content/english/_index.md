  heading: "One Health: A Unified Approach to Global Wellbeing"
  content: >
   One Health is an integrated approach that recognizes the deep interconnection between the health of people, animals, and ecosystems. It addresses critical challenges like antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic diseases, and environmental health. With 75% of emerging diseases, such as Nipah, Avian Influenza, and COVID-19, originating from animals, India's economy and public health are significantly impacted (Kumar et al., 2020). The One Health Framework, at the core of our app, offers a comprehensive tool built on key indicators and datasets. These indicators, adapted from the Global One Health Index Framework, provide insights into health trends, from air quality to zoonotic disease prevalence, using robust datasets from Indian sources like NFHS, FAO, and World Bank. By integrating this data, the framework empowers policy-makers, researchers, and citizens to make evidence-based decisions and take proactive actions for a healthier future.

  heading: "Understanding the One Health Index"
  content: >
   The One Health Index evaluates the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment through three key drivers: External Driver Index (EDI) assessing societal and environmental factors, Intrinsic Driver Index (IDI) measuring collaboration across health sectors, and Core Drivers Index (CDI) evaluating progress in addressing challenges like infectious diseases and climate change. By identifying strengths and gaps, the One Health Index helps focus resources and policies, addressing the current lack of clarity and data at the human-animal-environment interface.
