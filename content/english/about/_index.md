The Tata Institute for Genetics and Society (TIGS), founded in 2017, is a non-profit research institute that aspires to develop solutions to challenges in human health and agriculture. The most significant challenges that impede the achievement of health equity and nutrition security for all of India’s population require systematic evidence-based scientific advancements and technological solutions. In this regard, we are committed to contributing towards India’s accelerated path in emerging as a global power through concerted efforts that use science-based solutions to prevent infectious diseases, improve access to affordable and quality diagnostics and therapeutics for rare genetic disorders, foster health equity, and achieve nutrition security through sustainable models for agriculture.
