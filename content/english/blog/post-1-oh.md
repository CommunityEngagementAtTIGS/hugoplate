#### What is One Health?  
One Health is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals, and ecosystems over time. It's about understanding that our wellbeing is deeply interconnected with the natural world and the animals we share it with.
#### Why One Health is a concern?
India is currently grappling with several health challenges, including antimicrobial resistance, environmental health issues, and concerns related to food safety. Significantly, 75% of zoonotic diseases, such as Nipah, Avian Influenza, Scrub Typhus, Congo Fever, Kyasanur Forest Disease, COVID-19, and Leptospirosis, have a profound effect on the nation's economy (Kumar et al., 2020). Recent pandemics have highlighted insufficiency in public health policies, prompting the government to pledge support for the One Health (OH) approach and to enhance investment in public health infrastructure (Nambiar et al.). Moreover, with the escalation of challenges in recent years, experts have strongly recommended the OH approach not only to address the pandemic effectively but also to combat the infodemic through the prompt distribution of reliable information.
#### What is One Health Framework?

At the heart of our app lies the One Health Framework, a dynamic tool that empowers you to explore the interdependencies of health across our planet. This framework is built on two pillars: Indicators and Datasets.
 
_Indicators_ : These are the signposts of one health adopted from the Global One Health Framework that is carefully selected to provide insights into the wellbeing of humans, animals, and the environment. A list of one health indicators which were adopted from the Global One health index framework  were collected and  deep searched for data availability for example from air quality indices to zoonotic diseases prevalence, these indicators offer a snapshot of health at any given moment, enabling us to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and take pre-emptive actions. (Zhang et.al)
 
_Datasets_ : Behind every indicator is a wealth of data, collected from authoritative sources from Indian databases (NFHS, FAO, Worldbank, PIB India, Indiastats, Agricoop etc). These datasets are the backbone of our framework, offering a deep dive into the specifics of each health aspect. Whether you're a researcher, a policy-maker, or simply a concerned citizen, these datasets provide the evidence-based foundation for informed decision-making and effective action.
