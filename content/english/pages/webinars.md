### The Persistent Dangers Posed by Mosquito Borne Diseases
Date: June 2020

In June 2020, TIGS launched a webinar series called ‘Science Serving Society.’ In this series, we hope to address some of the biggest challenges we face in human health and agriculture today and bring together expert voices who have been working on developing solutions for these challenges. We also hope that this platform will be a springboard to generate conversations on these issues between stakeholders from all walks of life.

The first webinar from the series ‘The Persistent Dangers of Mosquito Borne Diseases’ addressed a problem we have been facing for several hundred years. Recognized as the deadliest animal in the world, the tiny mosquito serves as a vector for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and causes more than a dozen diseases. A global effort is underway to eliminate malaria, one such devastating mosquito-borne disease, by 2030. But with public health efforts now being focused on containing COVID19, mosquito-borne diseases threaten to make a comeback in full force this monsoon season in India.

### The Next Steps in Tackling AMR
Date: November 2020

The third webinar under the ‘Science Serving Society’ series was held on 23 November 2020 during World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW), which is observed to create awareness about a growing threat that could very well emerge as the next pandemic if left unchecked. TIGS invited a panel of experts to share their wealth of knowledge on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its implications in the present and future of public health.

### Antibiotics Overuse during the Pandemic: Impact on AMR
Date: November 2021

Moderator:
Dr. Vikas Singh, Senior Scientist, TIGS

Opening remarks:
Dr. Rakesh Mishra, Director, TIGS

Chair:
Prof. N.K. Ganguly, Former Director General, ICMR

Presentations:

‘The Antimicrobial Resistance Scenario in India’ by Dr. Neelam Taneja, Professor, Department of Medical Microbiology, PGIMER

‘The Burden of Antibiotic Overuse during the COVID-19 Pandemic’ by Dr. G.M. Varghese, Professor and Head, Department of Infectious Diseases, CMC Vellore

‘Novel Strategies for Diagnosis and Treatment Due to Multi-Drug Resistant Bacteria’ by Dr. Ruchi Singh, Scientist E, ICMR-National Institute of Pathology

Dr. Rakesh Mishra in his remarks mentioned that India has done well in working towards self-sufficiency in developing strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. But we must now also strengthen our efforts in dealing with our other public health concerns. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a silent tsunami in the making, and the misuse of antibiotics in healthcare, livestock, and fisheries needs to be addressed.

### Wastewater-Based Epidemiology: SARS-CoV-2 and beyond
Date: May 2022

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an important tool to understand the disease prevalence in a particular geographical area or community. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WBE has been extensively used by health authorities and researchers from several countries, including India, to keep a track on the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is found that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients shed viral fragments through the faeces. The viral RNA load in the human waste, which is collected as sewage or wastewater, can be used as a readout/proxy to estimate the prevalence of the disease in the community. Ease of assays, cost-effectiveness, and an unbiased approach towards public health, are a few advantages associated with WBE. By harnessing the power of statistics and modelling, it is now possible to have a real-time approach towards building robust prediction models, which can help health authorities to take informed decisions. WBE approach has been used to tackle diseases such as polio, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases, and to come up with effective solutions to achieve better public health outcomes.

### Surveillance of Vector-Borne Diseases: Exploring Newer Horizons
Date: June 2023

Vector-borne diseases have plagued human lives for centuries now. Recent advances in molecular biology, and genetics have enabled understanding of infection dynamics of various pathogens causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disease control and prevention involves both vector management and clinical alleviation and thus, surveillance and ecological studies play a crucial role in knowing the hotspots of both the vector and the infection in time and space. Novel methods for indexing vector population and advanced diagnostics and therapeutics to timely detect and treat affected population is the need of the hour.

This webinar ‘Surveillance of Vector-borne diseases: Exploring newer horizons’ shall focus on the need and methods of surveillance of vector-borne diseases.
