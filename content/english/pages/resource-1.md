## Introduction
Communicable diseases can cause epidemics and pandemics which have the potential to overwhelm the
capacity of communities; with serious health and socioeconomic consequences. In the past century four influenza pandemics resulted in an estimated 22 to 58 million
deaths.5
‘New’ pathogens with potential to cause pandemic continue to emerge. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) caused fewer than 10,000 cases with 774 deaths
but had a major impact upon national economies especially upon trade and tourism.6
The 194 Member States of WHO have agreed the International Health Regulations (2005)7 with the purpose of
preventing and controlling the international spread of adverse public health events, including epidemics. One of
the key obligations of States Parties to the IHR is to develop and maintain national core capacities for the
detection, investigation, response and reporting of public
health events within their territories.
